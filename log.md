## Day 0: Janary 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I set my objectives and wrote a the first problem.

**Thoughts:** I thought the work would be trivial and since I had already gone throught so many projects already. However, now I realize why they some problems made it to that list. I am more excited to do the rest now. I was able to implement the problem in Python, and then I tried to do the same in Java. In pursuit of doing so I ran out of time. I think I need to spend some more time with data types in JAVA and thats going to be my next move. Overall I learned a lot about data types like Decimal and why they would be used in real world. This already seems promising. Excited to see what happens next.
