# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day X: [Insert Date]

**Today's Progress**: write about todays progress

**Thoughts:** Brief description

**Link to work:** Link

## Day 1: January 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I implemented some of the algorithms code questions and graph based algo in python. Also learned about collections data structure in python

**Thoughts:** Progress has been slow I hope to pick it up once I decided what project I really want to pursue after this.

## Day 0: Janary 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I set my objectives and wrote a the first problem.

**Thoughts:** I thought the work would be trivial and since I had already gone throught so many projects already. However, now I realize why they some problems made it to that list. I am more excited to do the rest now. I was able to implement the problem in Python, and then I tried to do the same in Java. In pursuit of doing so I ran out of time. I think I need to spend some more time with data types in JAVA and thats going to be my next move. Overall I learned a lot about data types like Decimal and why they would be used in real world. This already seems promising. Excited to see what happens next.
